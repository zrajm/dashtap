** TODO 'test_init' should set state dir root
   '.fix/state' is the current state dir root, this should be exported in a
   variable from test_init so we won't have to change it in a hundred different
   test files if it ever changes.

** DONE Eliminate name collision with lockfile                          :BUG:
   CLOSED: [2014-07-07 Mon 00:36]
   Moved build state metadata into dir '.fix/state', while the lockfile
   continues to be called 'lock.pid'.
** DONE Tests which uses pre-defined metadata
   CLOSED: [2014-07-07 Mon 09:11]
   I.e. a whole bunch of tests are based on a state where a target has already
   been built once. This should use stored metadata (which could be easily
   re-built in case the metadata format changes).
** DONE Clean up and systematize test scripts
   CLOSED: [2014-07-11 Fri 21:19]
   Descriptions in TESTS.txt as well as the scripts themselves.
** DONE Eliminate need for 'sleep 1'

   Instead move timestamp backwards for all relevant files. (Is this really
   needed, or covered by the current test cases?) Modify chtime function to
   work for this.

   Test time went down from 14 seconds to 2 seconds (with 20 tests).
** DONE Modified 'init_test' + added 'cpdir'
   CLOSED: [2014-07-26 Sat 21:45]
   'init_test' no longer helps in creating the directory structure of the
   test's tempdir. Instead this has to be done manually (which simplifies
   reading the test script, since you can immediately see which directories are
   created).

   Added help function 'cpdir' which simplifies copying the relevant data
   directories from the test script data dir.
** DONE Test scripts should use 'title'
