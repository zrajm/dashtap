** TODO test_init should set state dir root
   '.fix/state' is the current state dir root, this should be exported in a
   variable from test_init so we won't have to change it in a hundred different
   test files if it ever changes.

   Moved build state metadata into dir '.fix/state', while the lockfile
   continues to be called 'lock.pid'.
** DONE Tests which uses pre-defined metadata
   CLOSED: [2014-07-07 Mon 09:11]
   I.e. a whole bunch of tests are based on a state where a target has already
   been built once. This should use stored metadata (which could be easily
   re-built in case the metadata format changes).
** DONE Clean up and systematize test scripts
   CLOSED: [2014-07-11 Fri 21:19]
   Descriptions in TESTS.txt as well as the scripts themselves.
** DONE Eliminate need for 'sleep 1'

   Instead move timestamp backwards for all relevant files. (Is this really
   needed, or covered by the current test cases?) Modify chtime function to
   work for this.

   Test time went down from 14 seconds to 2 seconds (with 20 tests).
