* Program
** TODO Dependencies
** TODO Automatic unlocking of stale lockfile
* Tests
** TODO Eliminate need for 'sleep 1'
   Instead move timestamp backwards for all relevant files. (Is this really
   needed, or covered by the current test cases?) Modify chtime function to
   work for this.
** TODO test_init should set state dir root
   '.fix/state' is the current state dir root, this should be exported in a
   variable from test_init so we won't have to change it in a hundred different
   test files if it ever changes.
** TODO change write_file argument order
   Permission bits & date should come *before* filename (to be consistent with
   touch and chmod).
** TODO Mooooaaar test cases!
** TODO Test killing of fix
* DONE
** DONE Tests should be run in tempdir

** DONE Eliminate name collision with lockfile                          :BUG:
   CLOSED: [2014-07-07 Mon 00:36]
   Moved build state metadata into dir '.fix/state', while the lockfile
   continues to be called 'lock.pid'.
** DONE Tests which uses pre-defined metadata
   CLOSED: [2014-07-07 Mon 09:11]
   I.e. a whole bunch of tests are based on a state where a target has already
   been built once. This should use stored metadata (which could be easily
   re-built in case the metadata format changes).
