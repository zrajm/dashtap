* Program
** TODO 'is_file' should only strip one trailing newline                :BUG:
   When this works, add test with two trailing newlines to
   'dashtap-strip_newline.t' as well.
** TODO Dashtap variables should have prefix DASHTAP_*
   Not TEST_* as they have now.
** TODO Eliminate as many $(...) as possible
   Each $(...) starts a subshell, which is inefficient, this should be avoided
   whenever possible.
** TODO Separate docs from source code
   Using Markdown?
** TODO Separate Fix.sh test helper functions from Dashtap
** TODO Put Dashtap in its own GitHub repo
   This would have to be automatically cloned and built by the Fix.sh build
   system. (Or at least have a very simple way of doing this described in the
   README.)
** TODO 'seteval' should test that variable name given is valid
** TODO Merge 'is_changed' and 'is_unchanged' to follow DRY
** TODO Add function 'read_file VARNAME FILE'
   Should read content of FILE into variable named VARNAME (preserving all
   whitespace). This function should be used by 'file_is', and 'execute'.
** TODO Function to test if a function exists
** TODO $BAIL_ON_FAIL/$DIE_ON_FAIL messages
   If $BAIL_ON_FAIL or $DIE_ON_FAIL contains a message, output that before
   exiting.
** TODO Extra fail message
   An extra fail message that can be set by a command, which will be displayed
   only as a diagnostic if there is a failure, and which is valid until it is
   reset.

   E.g. 'extra "TODO-related tests"' would add an extra line to the beginning
   of the failure message, like this:

       not ok 35 - Exit status
       #   TODO-related tests
       #   Failed test 'Exit status'
       #   in 'xt/dashtap-todo.t'
       #     GOT   : 255
       #     WANTED: 1

** DONE Test 'evalset'
   CLOSED: [2014-07-11 Fri 13:22]
** DONE Test 'error'
   CLOSED: [2014-07-11 Fri 16:53]
** DONE Add TODO tests
   CLOSED: [2014-07-12 Sat 18:18]
** DONE Change 'write_file' argument order
   CLOSED: [2014-07-13 Sun 06:27]
   Permission bits & date should come *before* filename (to be consistent with
   touch and chmod).
** DONE Add SKIP tests
   CLOSED: [2014-07-17 Thu 19:49]
** DONE Test 'TODO'
   CLOSED: [2014-07-18 Fri 18:31]

   CLOSED: [2014-07-18 Fri 18:31]
** DONE 'execute' should use only one trap
   CLOSED: [2014-07-20 Sun 09:10]
   A simple echo should suffice to catch the 'FULL' case, instead of the trap
   at the end of the 'execute' function.
** DONE Test 'varname'
   CLOSED: [2014-07-20 Sun 15:01]
** DONE 'varname' should not allow empty string or '_'                  :BUG:
   CLOSED: [2014-07-20 Sun 15:01]
** DONE Added 'strip_newline' and modified 'seteval' to make use of it
   CLOSED: [2014-07-20 Sun 18:38]
