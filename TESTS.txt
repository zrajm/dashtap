   This hardlink should, when created by Fix, always point to the current
   version of Fix. Previously it wasn't always recreated when needed, meaning
   that it sometimes pointed to a previous version. Test should write some
   (comment) to Fix executable, and see that this also appears in the hardlink.

   Don't test what kind of link it is (we don't care about that) only make sure
   that it points to the correct script.
