FAILURE means:
  + Exit status: >0
  + Failing target will not be modified (but a tempfile will be created).
  + Failing target's metadata will not be modified.
  + Nota Bene: Successful dependencies will be built even on error.

SUCCESS means:
  + Exit status: 0

Exit status:
  0  = Success.
  1  = Won't overwrite target (anything fixable by --force).
  5  = Build failed (buildscript returned non-zero exit value).
  6  = Failed to write target (even though build succeeded). E.g. target dir
       could not be created, old target (or the target directory) was write
       protected or similar.
  7  = Failed to write metadata.
  10 = Couldn't read buildscript or source (permission denied, or file
       missing, or missing buildscript or source directories).
  15 = Bad options provided.
